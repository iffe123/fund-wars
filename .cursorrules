# Fund Wars - Cursor Rules (Source-of-Truth: docs/FUND_WARS_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md)

These rules are the default constraints for AI-assisted changes in this repo.

## Product / Game Rules (Hard)
- The core loop is weekly turns with exactly **2 Action Points (AP)**.
- **No action can be repeated on the same target within a single week**; each action must advance state.
- Favor meaningful scarcity and consequential decisions over “more buttons” or reversible outcomes.
- NPCs are strategic assets with memory, preferences, and agendas; AI chat must degrade gracefully when offline/unavailable.

## Engineering Rules (Hard)
- TypeScript strictness is non-negotiable: no `any` unless genuinely unavoidable and justified.
- Keep modules focused; refactor if a single file grows beyond ~500 lines.
- No inline styles; use Tailwind utility classes (and shared tokens/patterns where applicable).
- Accessibility is required: semantic elements, ARIA labels where needed, and keyboard navigation for interactive UI.
- All game state mutations must go through explicit actions/reducers; avoid direct mutation.

## Quality Bar (Hard)
- Never expose technical errors to players; provide clear user-facing recovery paths.
- Prefer offline-first behavior: gameplay should work without network; AI features should be optional.
- Ensure tutorial overlays render above all modals (z-index discipline).

## Workflow Expectations
- Make changes that are small, typed, and testable.
- Update or add docs when behavior/architecture changes.
